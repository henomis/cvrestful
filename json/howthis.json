    "text": "<h3>How it's made</h3><h4>Concurrent version control</h4>One of the first steps was to create a <a target='_blank' href='https://git-scm.com/'>GIT</a> repository, I like to control my versions and I love GIT! Using GIT every change will be tracked, and you will be able to jump backward whenever you want. If you want you can download source code from my <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/henomis/cvrestful'>Github repository</a>.<h4>Web service</h4>I developed, for this pourpose, a kind of <i>C scripting web framework</i>, this means that you can write your web application using C as script language. How this is possible?<br>I combined various software: a C copiler/interpreter <a target='_blank' href='http://bellard.org/tcc/'>TinyC</a> developed by Fabrice Bellard (yes, is the Qemu author!), a Markdown parser <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/vmg/sundown'>Sundown</a>, and <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/cesanta/fossa'>Fossa</a> a simple C network library. With these two tools I developed a web server that is capable to serve static contents (.html, .css, .js, etc.), RESTFUL API, and websocket stream.<h4>Contents</h4>All the contents of this web page are <a target='_blank' href='http://www.json.org'>JSON</a> or <a target='_blank' href='http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/'>Markdown</a> documents, so if you don't like my web presentation you are able to use your custom interface and call my APIs :) Asynchronous calls, such as Ajax and websocket, are made using <a target='_blank' href='http://www.jquery.org'>jQuery</a> javascript framework. This web page uses <a target='_blank' href='http://www.getbootstrap.com'>Twitter Bootstrap</a> as web site skeleton, so contents are almost styled using its class. There is also a custom CSS for the rest.<h4>Keywords</h4>You'll find all the keywords <span class='cv-info'>highlighted using a blue line</span>."
